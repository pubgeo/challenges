# Public Challenges and Datasets
This is a summary of public datasets and challenges that our team at JHU/APL has developed. Links are provided for more detailed information. We are grateful to [SpaceNet](https://spacenetchallenge.github.io/datasets/datasetHomePage.html), [IEEE DataPort](https://ieee-dataport.org/), and [Amazon](https://registry.opendata.aws/) for hosting these large datasets.

## IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest (2019)
The 2019 Data Fusion Contest (DFC19), organized by the Image Analysis and Data Fusion Technical Committee (IADF TC) of the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society (GRSS), the Johns Hopkins University (JHU), and the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA), aimed to promote research in semantic 3D reconstruction and stereo using machine intelligence and deep learning applied to satellite images. The DFC19 dataset is available on [IEEE DataPort](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/data-fusion-contest-2019-dfc2019). For more information about the dataset and baselines, please see our [WACV'19 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08739).

## IARPA CORE3D Public Data (2018)
IARPA has publicly released DigitalGlobe satellite imagery for the Creation of Operationally Realistic 3D Environment (CORE3D) program to enable performer teams to crowdsource manual labeling efforts and to promote public research that aligns well with the CORE3D programâ€™s objectives. [SpaceNet](https://spacenetchallenge.github.io/datasets/Core_3D_summary.html) is hosting the CORE3D public dataset in the SpaceNet repository to ensure easy access to the data.

## IARPA Functional Map of the World Challenge (2017)
The IARPA Functional Map of the World (fMoW) challenge invited experts from across the government, academia, industry, and developer communities-with or without experience in automated image analysis-to create fast and accurate classification algorithms for building and land use. Although the challenge has now ended, it was responsible for the release of the largest public annotated satellite image dataset to date. The dataset contains over one million images and over one million annotated points of interest and is designed to enable the development of novel algorithms and data fusion techniques to address several computer vision and remote sensing research problems. Source code for the baseline algorithm and winning solutions as well as links to download the fMoW dataset are available [here](https://github.com/fmow). For more information about the dataset and baseline, please see our [CVPR'18 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07846).

## USSOCOM Urban 3D Challenge (2017)
This challenge  published a large-scale dataset containing 2D orthorectified RGB and 3D Digital Surface Models and Digital Terrain Models generated from commercial satellite imagery covering over 360 km of terrain and containing roughly 157,000 annotated building footprints. All image products are provided at 50 cm ground sample distance. This unique 2D/3D large scale dataset provides researchers an opportunity to utilize machine learning techniques to further improve state of the art performance. [SpaceNet](https://spacenetchallenge.github.io/datasets/Urban_3D_Challenge_summary.html) is hosting the Urban 3D Challenge dataset in the SpaceNet repository to ensure easy access to the data. Open source projects for winning solutions are hosted by [TopCoder](https://github.com/topcoderinc/Urban3d).

## IARPA Multi-View Stereo 3D Mapping Challenge (2016)
The IARPA Multi-View Stereo 3D Mapping Challenge invited experts from across government, academia, industry and solver communities to derive accurate 3D point clouds from multi-view satellite imagery. The challenge provided nearly 50 commercial satellite images covering 100 square kilometers. [SpaceNet](https://spacenetchallenge.github.io/datasets/mvs_summary.html) is hosting the Multi-View Stereo 3D Mapping dataset in the SpaceNet repository to ensure easy access to the data.
